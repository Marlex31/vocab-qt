sorting only works on saved items, those not saved are discarded upon sorting - SOLVED -

next item to added editing - SOLVED - needs to be moved into main add_item func without errors, when text is already added and edited don't edit

sorting results is discarding the original order of added items

item search only works on column 1 - SOLVED - might want to add suppport for all columns at the same time, could use a dict for all lists and corresponding items and then loop over

search bar not scaling to col amount

special char sorting with same family

no text magnification

might want to change list and other var names to match indicies ex: self.list_0

what to do when list is at the bottom and the user can't see right - could always add empty items (uneditable?) and substract from status bar

theme switch does not completly work then opening another file with the dark theme enabled - SOLVED -

sync option for list scrolling - SOLVED -

add exit shortcut - SOLVED -

transfer clear_selection to utility file
